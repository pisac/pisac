## Pisac - Keep git commit histories clean


Commits are one of the critical parts of a Git repository, and more so, the commit message is a lifelog for the repository. As the project evolves (new features getting added, bugs being fixed, architecture being refactored), commit letters can see what was changed and how. So these messages must reflect the underlying change in a short, precise manner.


#### Git commits history is straightforward to mess up. Here's how you can fix it!


**Pisac** is added to your CI, and when they commit description failed validation, an error occurs. Usually, everyone in the project gets an error message, so you can stop your friends from writing the ugly story. ðŸ˜ˆ


## Configuration

To configure the validation rules, you need to create a new file called `pisac.json` in the project root. For example:

```json
{
  "pattern": "(Added|Changed|Deprecated|Removed|Fixed|Security) \\w+",
  "message": "The commit must start with words (Added|Changed|Deprecated|Removed|Fixed|Security)",
  "limit": 5,
  "skip": [
    "Fix styling",
    "Initial commit"
  ]
}
```

## GitHub Actions

You can use it as a GitHub Actions by creating a file `.github/workflows/pisac.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
TODO:
```

## Docker

A Docker-Image is built automatically and located here: https://hub.docker.com/r/...

You can run it in any given directory like this:

```bash
TODO:
```

## Phar

Sometimes your project can conflict with one or more of Pisac dependencies. In that case, you may find the Phar (a self-contained PHP executable) useful. The Phar can be downloaded from GitHub:

```bash
TODO:
```

You can also install it as a composer dependency **(Not recommended)**:

```bash
$ composer require pisac/pisac
```

And then run as executable:

```bash
$ php vendor/bin/pisac check
```
